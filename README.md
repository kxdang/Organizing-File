# File Organizer
My first python script I wrote to clean up Downloads folder after reading "Automate the Boring Stuff with Python" by Al Sweigart
## Installation
Windows OS only.
Requires python and PyInstaller with the line "pyinstaller â€“onefile OrganizingFiles.py" 
It creates a one-file bundled executable for you to schedule the program via Windows Scheduler
## Usage
You can edit the OrganizingFiles.py code using a text editor

For creating a new desired folder you must define what the folder would be


e.g To make a music folder

new_path_music = os.getcwd() + "\Music"
